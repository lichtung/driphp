# WorkQuene(TaskQueue)
Always is used to distribute time-consuming tasks among multiple workers.


The main idea behind Work Queues is to avoid doing a resource-intensive task immediately and having to wait for it to complete.
在介绍工作队列之前，你首先需要知道立即执行一个资源密集型（花费大量时间或内存）的任务并等待其完成是错误的
Instead we schedule the task to be done later.
而是安排任务等待被执行

This concept is especially useful in web applications where it's impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request window.
web应用程序在处理一个http请求期间处理一个复杂任务是不可能的，这个观点尤其重要

One of the advantages of using a Task Queue is the ability to easily parallelize work.
If we are building up a backlog of work, we can just add more workers and that way, scale easily.
使用任务队列的一个好处就是可以容易地并行工作
如果要增加一堆工作任务，只要增加处理线程就好了



Round-robin dispatching 循环调度
By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer, in sequence.
On average every consumer will get the same number of messages. 每个消费者几乎分配到相同数量的消息数量
This way of distributing messages is called round-robin. Try this out with three or more workers.

Message acknowledgment 消息答复
Doing a task can take a few seconds. You may wonder what happens if one of the consumers starts a long task and dies with it only partly done.
一些人物可能完成了部分工作后直接退出，你需要知道发生了什么
With our current code, once RabbitMQ delivers a message to the customer it immediately marks it for deletion.
 In this case, if you kill a worker we will lose the message it was just processing.
RabbitMQ传递一个消息给消费者的时候会立即标记这个消息失效，假若如此，你杀死一个处理正在处理任务的消费者的时候，同时也丢失了消息本身
In order to make sure a message is never lost, RabbitMQ supports message acknowledgments.
An acknowledgement is sent back by the consumer to tell RabbitMQ that a particular message has been received, processed and that RabbitMQ is free to delete it.
为了知道一个消息是否丢失，RabbitMQ支持消息答复，消费者返回一个消息答复RabbitMQ这个消息接收并处理完成，你可以删除它了
If a consumer dies (its channel is closed, connection is closed, or TCP connection is lost) without sending an ack,
RabbitMQ will understand that a message wasn't processed fully and will re-queue it.
如果消费者挂掉了，并且没有返回一个发福，RabbitMQ就会明白这个消息未被完全处理，会将其重新放入队列中


**Forgotten acknowledgment 忘记答复*
It's a common mistake to miss the ack. It's an easy error, but the consequences are serious.
编程时缺少答复是一个常见的失误，错误很容易发生，但是后果是严重的

Message durability 消息持久化
We have learned how to make sure that even if the consumer dies, the task isn't lost. But our tasks will still be lost if RabbitMQ server stops.
RabbitMQ推出时消息仍然会丢失
When RabbitMQ quits or crashes it will forget the queues and messages unless you tell it not to.
RabbitMQ退出或者崩溃时会丢失队列和消息，除非你让它别丢失...
Two things are required to make sure (确保) that messages aren't lost: we need to mark both the queue and messages as durable (持久的；耐用品).
两件事情可以确保消息不会丢失：我们需要标记消息和队列为持久的

First, we need to make sure that RabbitMQ will never lose our queue. In order to do so, we need to declare it as durable. To do so we pass the third parameter to queue_declare as true:
首先声明队列为持久的

```php
 $channel->queue_declare('hello2', false, true, false, false);
```

Although this command is correct by itself, it won't work in our present setup. That's because we've already defined a queue called hello which is not durable. RabbitMQ doesn't allow you to redefine an existing queue with different parameters and will return an error to any program that tries to do that. But there is a quick workaround - let's declare a queue with different name, for example task_queue:
无法定义重名的消息队列，即便名称不同
```php
 $channel->queue_declare('task_queue', false, true, false, false);
```
This flag set to true needs to be applied to both the producer and consumer code.
生产者和消费者需要同时设置为true或者false
At this point we're sure that the task_queue queue won't be lost even if RabbitMQ restarts. Now we need to mark our messages as persistent - by setting the delivery_mode = 2 message property which AMQPMessage takes as part of the property array.
队列持久化的同时消息队列也需要设置持久化参数
```php
 $msg = new AMQPMessage($data, array('delivery_mode' => AMQPMessage::DELIVERY_MODE_PERSISTENT) );
```
消息持久化的备注：
Marking messages as persistent doesn't fully guarantee that a message won't be lost.
Although it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk, there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and hasn't saved it yet.
RabbitMQ收到消息的时候未保存便退出的情况下，消息的持久化不能百分之百保证
 Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do fsync(2) for every message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the disk.
并且RabbitMQ对于持久化的消息可能选择保存到高速缓存中，而不是写入硬盘
The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough for our simple task queue.
尽管持久保证不是非常强大，但对于简单的任务队列而言已经能够足够了

Fair dispatch 公平调度
You might have noticed that the dispatching still doesn't work exactly as we want.
For example in a situation with two workers, when all odd messages are heavy and even messages are light, one worker
will be constantly busy and the other one will do hardly any work.
Well, RabbitMQ doesn't know anything about that and will still dispatch messages evenly.
实际工作中可能发现调度并不完全是我们期望的那样，比如一个任务队列繁忙而其他的轻松。
实际上，RabbitMQ并不知道详细情况，它只负责平均分配
This happens because RabbitMQ just dispatches a message when the message enters the queue.
这是因为但消息进入队列的时候，RabbitMQ只负责传递消息
It doesn't look at the number of unacknowledged messages for a consumer. It just blindly dispatches every n-th message to the n-th consumer.
它不检查消费者有多少个未答复的消息，而只管盲目地调度第N个消息给第N个队列

In order to defeat that we can use the basic_qos method with the prefetch_count = 1 setting.
This tells RabbitMQ not to give more than one message to a worker at a time.
Or, in other words, don't dispatch a new message to a worker until it has processed and acknowledged the previous one.
这告诉RabbitMQ不要给一个消费者多余一个正在处理的消息，换而言之，消费者正在处理的时候不要给它调度
Instead, it will dispatch it to the next worker that is not still busy.
等到空闲下来的和后哦再调度
```php
$channel->basic_qos(null, 1, null);
```
