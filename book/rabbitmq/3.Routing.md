# Routing
In the previous tutorial we built a simple logging system. We were able to broadcast log messages to many receivers.

In this tutorial we're going to add a feature to it - we're going to make it possible to subscribe only to a subset of the messages. 
这篇教程的目的是添加一个新的功能：将消息传递给部分消费者

For example, we will be able to direct only critical error messages to the log file (to save disk space), 
while still being able to print all of the log messages on the console.
比如，错误消息存盘，而所有的消息都打印到屏幕中。

# Bindings
In previous examples we were already creating bindings. You may recall code like:
```php
$channel->queue_bind($queue_name, 'logs');
```
A binding is a relationship between an exchange and a queue. 
This can be simply read as: the queue is interested in messages from this exchange.
绑定是交换机和队列之间的一种关系，可以解读成：队列对交换机的这类消息感兴趣

Bindings can take an extra routing_key parameter. To avoid the confusion(混乱；混淆) with a $channel::basic_publish parameter we're 
going to call it a binding key. This is how we could create a binding with a key:
绑定可以附加一个routing_key参数，为了避免和$channel::basic_publish的参数相混淆，我们叫它binding key
```php
$binding_key = 'black';
$channel->queue_bind($queue_name, $exchange_name, $binding_key);
```
The meaning of a binding key depends on the exchange type.
binding key的含义由交换机类型决定
The fanout exchanges, which we used previously, simply ignored its value.

# Direct exchange 直接交换机
Our logging system from the previous tutorial broadcasts all messages to all consumers. 
We want to extend that to allow filtering messages based on their severity.
根据消息的严重登记进行过滤

We were using a fanout exchange, which doesn't give us much flexibility(灵活性) - it's only capable(胜任的) of mindless(不经过脑经的) broadcasting.

We will use a direct exchange instead. The routing algorithm(算法) behind a direct exchange is simple - 
a message goes to the queues whose binding key exactly matches the routing key of the message.
只有绑定key完全符合的才会接收消息

To illustrate that, consider the following setup:
为阐明原理，仔细看下面的

### Multiple bindings 多个绑定
It is perfectly legal to bind multiple queues with the same binding key. 
In our example we could add a binding between X and Q1 with binding key black. 
In that case, the direct exchange will behave like fanout and will broadcast the message to all the matching queues. 
A message with routing key black will be delivered to both Q1 and Q2.
